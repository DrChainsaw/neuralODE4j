## Getting Started

GIT clone and run with maven or in IDE.

```
git clone https://github.com/DrChainsaw/neuralODE4j
cd neuralODE4j
mvn install
```

The class OdeVertex is used to add an arbitrary graph of Layers or GraphVertices as an ODE block in a ComputationGraph. OdeVertex
extends GraphVertex and can be added to a GraphBuilder just as any other vertex. It has a similar API as GraphBuilder for adding 
layers and vertices. 

Example:
```
        final ComputationGraph graph = new ComputationGraph(new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder()
                .graphBuilder()
                .addInputs("input")
                .setInputTypes(InputType.convolutional(9, 9, 3))
                .addLayer("normalLayer0",
                        new Convolution2D.Builder(3, 3)
                                .nOut(32)
                                .convolutionMode(ConvolutionMode.Same).build(), "input")

                // Add an ODE block called "odeBlock" to the graph.
                .addVertex("odeBlock", 
                        new OdeVertex.Builder("odeLayer0", new BatchNormalization.Builder().build())
                        
                        // OdeVertex has a similar API as GraphBuilder for adding new layers/vertices to the OdeBlock
                        .addLayer("odeLayer1", new Convolution2D.Builder(3, 3)
                                .nOut(32)
                                .convolutionMode(ConvolutionMode.Same).build(), "odeLayer0")
                        
                        // Add more layers and vertices as desired
                        
                        // Build the OdeVertex. All layers added to it will be treated as an ODE
                        .build(), "normalLayer0")

                // Layers can be added to the graph after the ODE block
                .addLayer("normalLayer1", new BatchNormalization.Builder().build(), "odeBlock")
                .setOutputs("output")
                .addLayer("output", new CnnLossLayer(), "normalLayer1")
                .build());
```

Method for solving the ODE can be configured:

```
new OdeVertex.Builder(...)
    .odeConf(new FixedStep(
                      new DormandPrince54Solver(),
                      Nd4j.arange(0,2))) // Integrate between t = 0 and t = 1
```

Currently, the only ODE solver implementation which is integrated with Nd4j is [DormandPrince54Solver](./src/main/java/ode/solve/impl/DormandPrince54Solver.java), 
It is however possible to use FirstOrderIntegrators from apache.commons:commons-math3 through [FirstOrderSolverAdapter](./src/main/java/ode/solve/commons/FirstOrderSolverAdapter.java)
at the cost of slower training and inference speed.

Time can also be input from another vertex:
```
new OdeVertex.Builder(...)
    .odeConf(new InputStep(solverConf, 1)) // Number "1" refers to input "time" on the line below
    .build(), "someLayer", "time");  
```

Implementations of the MNIST and spiral generation toy experiments from the paper can be found under examples [[link]](./src/main/java/examples)

### Prerequisites

Maven and GIT. Project uses ND4Js CUDA 10 backend as default which requires [CUDA 10](https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/deeplearning4j-config-cudnn).
To use CPU backend instead, set the maven property backend-CPU:

```
mvn install -P backend-CPU
```

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Head over to the issues page and either add a new issue or pick up and existing one.

## Versioning

TBD. I will try to add a maven artifact whenever I find the time for it.
